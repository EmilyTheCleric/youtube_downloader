IMPORTANT:
just run the ytmp3.exe file, if anything breaks @me on discord at Emilbee#9025
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT IT
May take a while to run on first launch, should be faster on successive launches
DON'T USE A LIVE VIDEO LINK, you will get caught in an infinite loop from which there is no return (except exiting the program)
if you make a mistake while inputting time, it will (hopefully) default to the beginning and end of a video

it may break if:
you input something weird when it says to input (mm:ss) (PROBABLY FIXED)
if the youube video has weird chars in it (already takes care of \, ., and some others but I may not have gotten them all) (I think i got them all?)
